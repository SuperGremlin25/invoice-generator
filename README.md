## üì¶ Packaging

### Commercial Distribution

For commercial distribution, use the dedicated build scripts located in the `commercial_distribution` directory. These scripts create packages that store user configurations in the appropriate system-wide application data folders, ensuring a clean and professional user experience.

#### Windows Commercial Build

Use the PowerShell script in the `commercial_distribution` folder:

```powershell
# Navigate to the commercial distribution directory
cd commercial_distribution

# Run the build script
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build_commercial_windows.ps1
```

This will generate a zipped package named `InvoiceGeneratorPremium_Windows_Commercial.zip` containing the executable and all necessary files.

#### macOS Commercial Build

Use the shell script in the `commercial_distribution` folder:

```bash
# Navigate to the commercial distribution directory
cd commercial_distribution

# Make the script executable
chmod +x build_commercial_mac.sh

# Run the build script
./build_commercial_mac.sh
```

This will generate a zipped package named `InvoiceGeneratorPremium_macOS_Commercial.zip` containing the `.app` bundle and other files.

### Development Builds

You can create standalone executables for both Windows and macOS for development purposes.

You can create standalone executables for both Windows and macOS.

### Windows Build

#### Option 1: PowerShell Script (Recommended)

Use the included PowerShell script which creates a clean build with a timestamped filename:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build_premium.ps1
```

This script will:
- Create a clean build environment
- Build the executable with a unique timestamped name
- Place the final executable in the `dist_new` folder

#### Option 2: Manual PyInstaller Command

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Run the build command**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "InvoiceGeneratorPremium" invoice.py
   ```

### macOS Build

#### Option 1: Shell Script (Recommended)

Use the included shell script to create a macOS application:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x build_mac.sh

# Run the build script
./build_mac.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a clean build environment
- Build the application with a unique timestamped name
- Place the final executable in the `dist_mac` folder

#### Option 2: Manual PyInstaller Command

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Run the build command**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m PyInstaller --windowed --onefile --name "InvoiceGeneratorPremium" invoice.py
   ```

3. **Make the executable runnable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x dist/InvoiceGeneratorPremium
   ```

### Creating a proper macOS .app bundle

For a more native macOS experience, you can convert the executable into a proper .app bundle using [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus):

1. **Install Platypus**:
   ```bash
   brew install platypus
   ```

2. **Create the .app bundle**:
   ```bash
   platypus -a 'Invoice Generator Premium' -o 'Text' -I 'com.digitalinsurgent.invoicegenerator' -f dist_mac/InvoiceGeneratorPremium -i app_icon.png -y dist_mac/InvoiceGeneratorPremium.app
   ```
